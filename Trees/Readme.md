Prerequisites - Learn These First:

Tree Structure - Node with left, right pointers
Tree Traversals:

Inorder (Left, Root, Right) - gives sorted for BST
Preorder (Root, Left, Right)
Postorder (Left, Right, Root)
Level Order (BFS)


BST Property - Left < Root < Right
Recursion - Most tree problems use recursion
DFS vs BFS - When to use each
